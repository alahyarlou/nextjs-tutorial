## Hello Everyone 😍 🖐️

I've decided to jot down the key points I'm learning while studying ``Next.js`` here for myself, so I can review them later. If you've found them useful or enjoyable, please give me a star so that I can gather energy to continue sharing these kinds of tutorials.

Thank you all.

**By the way,Don't forget to share this with others.**
